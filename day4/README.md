Day 4 focused on mastering Python's control flow tools—if, elif, and else—and applying them to create practical decision-making scripts. As a mini-project, I designed and built an interactive command-line Quiz App to solidify these foundational skills.

What I Learned
Core Concepts
How to use if, elif, and else for branching logic

Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

Logical operators: and, or, not

Boolean concepts in Python

The importance of indentation and block structure

Practice Exercises
Writing conditional scripts to:

Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero

Classify a person’s life stage by age

Award points based on random "alien colors" (simple game)

Check for membership in a list using if ... in ...

Developing input validation and user feedback patterns

Prompting Skills
Learned to write clear prompts for AI/code assistance

Used AI suggestions to debug and improve logic

Practiced asking for code reviews and explanations

Practice Code
Examples
Alien Color Points Game:
Award points based on a randomly chosen color from a list using conditional blocks.

Life Stage Classifier:
User input age is analyzed with a chain of if/elif/else to print the correct stage of life.

Favorite Fruit Checker:
Independent if statements check for the presence of fruits in a favorites list.

Mini-Project: Command-Line Quiz App
Features
Asks 3–5 questions to the user via the terminal.

Accepts and normalizes user answers (case-insensitive, trims spaces).

Compares input with correct answers and updates the user's score.

Provides immediate feedback after each question.

Shows final score and a tailored message at the end.

Code is modular and fully commented for readability.

Example Output
text
Question 1: What is the capital of France?
Your answer: paris
Correct!

Question 2: What is 2 + 2?
Your answer: 4
Correct!

Question 3: What color do you get by mixing red and blue?
Your answer: purple
Correct!

You scored 3 out of 3.
Excellent! You got all questions right!
File Organization
exercises.py: Contains all practice scripts for control flow, input handling, and list membership.

quiz_app.py: The complete quiz mini-project.

README.md: This summary of Day 4

(Optional) .gitignore: For excluding unnecessary files

How to Run
Clone or download this folder.

Open a terminal and cd to day04_control_flow.

What Was Challenging
Handling user input errors gracefully (e.g., when expecting numbers)

Ensuring all branches in if/elif statements were mutually exclusive

Writing clear, professional commit messages summarizing each addition or bug fix

Prompts and AI Workflow
Practiced writing precise code prompts for real debugging and optimization

Asked for explanations of mistakes and got direct code reviews from the AI assistant

Used AI to brainstorm enhancements for the quiz app

Sample Commit Messages
"Add age classification script"

"Implement random alien color points game"

"Build command-line quiz app with scoring"

"Update README with project summary and usage instructions"

Reflection
Confidence: I now feel comfortable using if statements and handling multiple logical paths in scripts.

AI Skills: My prompting is more effective for both debugging and feature brainstorming.

Portfolio Progress: Added a meaningful project (CLI quiz app) to my GitHub, with well-documented commits and a clear README.

Next Steps
Move on to loops and repetition in Python.

Continue to integrate prompting best practices and GitHub workflow into daily projects.

Start planning feature ideas for the GitPy Studio final project.

Day 4 is a strong foundation on which to build more complex logic and interactive applications as I progress!
