🚀 100 Days of Python: My Learning & Portfolio Journey
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python project!
This repository documents my daily progress as I learn Python from the ground up, building practical projects and developing job-ready skills. My goal is to become a confident, independent Python developer and create a portfolio that demonstrates my abilities to future employers, collaborators, and the open-source community.

📅 What is This Project?
A 100-day challenge: Every day, I learn new Python concepts and apply them by building mini-projects or solving coding exercises.

Project-based learning: I focus on hands-on coding, not just theory.

Portfolio building: All my code, projects, and progress are tracked publicly here on GitHub.

Professional workflow: I use Git for version control and follow best practices in code organization and documentation.

🏆 Goals
Master Python fundamentals and advanced concepts

Build a diverse portfolio of real-world projects (automation, web, data, games, and more)

Practice clean, professional coding habits

Learn to use essential tools (IDEs, virtual environments, linters, testing, etc.)

Prepare for junior developer roles, internships, or freelance work

📚 What You’ll Find Here
Daily folders: Each day has its own folder with code, notes, and mini-projects

Milestone projects: Larger, more complex apps at key points in the journey

README updates: Regular summaries of what I’ve learned and built

Commit history: Transparent record of my growth and progress

💡 Why 100 Days?
Consistency and practice are the keys to mastering programming.
By coding every day, I’m building real skills, not just reading about them.

🌱 Progress
Day 1: Python setup, basic syntax, variables, input/output, Git & GitHub workflow
